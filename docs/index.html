                    SHAKATA is all about bringing the carnival to town and

                    This truly international band, with members hailing from
                    four continents, will take you on a dance-filled journey
                    from the Balkan peninsula to the beaches of Brazil and
                    everywhere in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The band formed in 2020 at Berklee College of Music in
                    Valencia and immediately became known for their fun and
                    funky repertoire and high energy live performances.
                    Absorbing from the cultural and musical origins of each
                    member (Israel, Brazil, Sicily, United States), the ensemble
                    takes influences from Balkan and Arabic music and fuses them
                    with Brazilian and Spanish rhythms and a hint of American
                    Blues to complete the signature SHAKATA sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an unorthodox and flavourful groove that keeps the
                    party rocking!
                </p>
                <p>
